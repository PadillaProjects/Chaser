## Core Aesthetic: "The Unseen Pursuit"

The game's atmosphere is built on **tension, paranoia, and the fear of being caught**. Unlike standard fitness apps that are bright and encouraging, Chaser is dark, gritty, and intense.

**Key Emotions:**
- **Urgency**: "I need to move *now*."
- **Paranoia**: "Is the chaser getting closer?"
- **Relief**: "I escaped... for now."

## Visual Design

### Color Palette

The interface uses a "Dark Mode" baseline with high-contrast signal colors.

| Color | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| **Void Black** | `#0a0a0a` | Main background |
| **Fog Grey** | `#1a1a1a` | Cards / secondary backgrounds |
| **Blood Red** | `#ff3b30` | **Chaser**, Alerts, Danger warnings |
| **Pulse Blue** | `#32aadf` | **Runner**, Safety, Progress |
| **Ghost White** | `#e0e0e0` | Primary Text |
| **Toxic Green** | `#2ecc71` | Stamina / Boost Items |
| **Warning Yellow** | `#f1c40f` | Close Call indicators |

### UI Elements

*   **Fonts**: 
    *   *Headers*: **'Creepster'** or **'Nosifer'** (Google Fonts) for game titles and "CAPTURED" events.
    *   *Body*: **'Roboto Mono'** or **'JetBrains Mono'** for a tactical, survival-gear feel.
*   **Buttons**: Sharp edges, slight glow effects (neon), glitched text animations on press.
*   **Vignette**: Permanent dark vignette on screen edges to create a claustrophobic feel.

## Audio Design

Sound is the primary driver of tension when the phone is in a pocket.

### 1. The Heartbeat System
The background audio loops a heartbeat sound that adapts to the **proximity of the Chaser**.

- **Safe Zone (>2km)**: Silence or faint wind/ambience.
- **Caution Zone (1km - 2km)**: Slow, steady heartbeat (60 BPM).
- **Danger Zone (500m - 1km)**: Elevated heartbeat (100 BPM), slightly louder.
- **Critical Zone (<500m)**: Rapid, pounding heartbeat (160 BPM), "Whoosh" effects.

### 2. Sound Effects (SFX)
- **Notification**: Sharp, jarring sounds (like a metal gate slamming or a violin screech) instead of pleasant chimes.
- **Capture**: A loud "Jumpscare" sound effect (slam + scream or sudden bass drop).
- **Item Use**:
    *   *Trip*: Breaking bone or snapping twig sound.
    *   *Boost*: Adrenaline injection hiss.

## Visual FX Implementation

### The "Glitch" Effect
When the Chaser gets close (<500m), the UI should start to visually degrade.

```dart
// lib/widgets/visuals/glitch_effect.dart
class GlitchEffect extends StatelessWidget {
  final Widget child;
  final double intensity; // 0.0 to 1.0 based on proximity

  // Implementation would use a shader (FragmentProgram)
  // to displace pixels horizontally and separate RGB channels
}
```

### The "Blood Overlay"
When a runner is captured, the screen doesn't just show a dialog; it cracks or gets covered in a red overlay.

---

## Haptic Feedback

Use vibration patterns to signal danger without looking at the screen.

- **Chaser Moved**: Short, sharp vibration.
- **Close Call**: Double heartbeat vibration pattern.
- **Captured**: Long, continuous intense vibration.

---

## Narrative Tone

All copy should be threatening and direct.

| Standard App | Chaser (Horror Theme) |
|--------------|----------------------|
| "Game Started!" | "The Hunt Begins." |
| "You joined the session." | "You have entered the kill zone." |
| "5000 steps remaining." | "Don't stop running." |
| "Game Over" | "No Survivors." |

---

## Next Steps
- Update [Race Track Visualization](/chaser/race-track-visualization) to match dark theme.
- Update [Notifications](/chaser/notifications) with new copy.
